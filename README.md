# Simple react website

I made this to practice react after finishing a course.
Feel free to use it for your own website but let me know if you make it look nicer :)

[Live version](http://clarinet.u-strasbg.fr/~renato/)

### Customization
All customization is done in the cv-data.js file. There, the script finds the information to populate the website elements.


### Libraries used
- [React](https://reactjs.org/)
- [React Scripts](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app)
- [Vertical Timeline for React](https://github.com/veysiyildiz/vertical-timeline-component-for-react)
- [Material UI](https://material-ui.com)

### Future work
- Translations
- Cooler timeline + filters
- Better looking skills section
- add reCaptcha to email
